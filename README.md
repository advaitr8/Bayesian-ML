# Bayesian-ML

1. naive_Bayes_classifier contains a machine learning algorithm that implements a classifier for spam and non spam email.
2. VI_normal_gamma contains a Bayesian implementation of a variational inference algorithm. Normal likelihood function. Normal prior on weights. Gamma priors on precision.
3. EM_matrix_factorization contains an EM algorithm for the object recommendation problem. The ratings of movies are distributed with a normal likelihood that are functions of movie info and user info. Using matrix factorization I set up the algorithm to calculate a low rank approximation of the ratings.
